## Tags

It is recommended to access a data source using a tag. Datasets are tagged by folder code. For example, `xyz--folder-name` has code `xyz`, so a tag could be like `xyz-v1`. 

See [Releases](https://github.com/cookwcode/data/releases) for info on specific data updates. Checkout the dataset readme's for data documentation.
